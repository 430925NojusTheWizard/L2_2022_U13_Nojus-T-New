Note: the cart and user go through the contact button when in mobile form (i would make the navbar adjust size to fit everything without overlaping )

Note: Images in the "Best Selling Products" stretch when zoomed, Object fit: cover somewhat fixed that by keeping the image consistant but cutting the parts that spill out, currently have no idea how to fix that, i had object fit cover disabled as it cuts off the top and bottom part of nokia 3310
